# How the sensitivity matrix is store, and how the conjugate gradient method is implemented
# 0: store a full sensitivity matrix, and use the lscg implementation of Eigen 3 library (not recommended) (lscg: least square conjugate gradient method) 
# 1: store a full sensitivity matrix, and use my own implementation of the lscg method
# 2: use the wavelet transform to compress the sensitivity matrix, and use my own implementation of the lscg method

# If the above option is 2 (using wavelet transform), the following relative threshold should be defined
# A larger threshold results in larger compression ratio, and larger approximation error as well

#Weights of different regularization terms: a_s, a_r, a_theta, a_phi, a_crg
#  (1) a_s is the weight of zero-order regularization (smallness constraint). 
#  (2) a_r, a_theta and a_phi are weights of the first-order regularization (smoothness constraint)
#  (3) a_crg is the weight of cross-gradient constraint, which makes sense only if the cross-gradient constraint is used
