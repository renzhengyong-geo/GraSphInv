Height of data from the reference surface is 50000
Reference level is 6378137

Number of observation points: 1681
Range of the latitude: 20, 40

Surface integral formulae is used in forward modeling, which is calculated by 4-th order Gauss-Legendre quadrature 

Use the wavelet transform to compress the sensitivity matrix, and use my own implementation of the lscg method

alpha_r=0.1
alpha_theta=1
alpha_phi=1

Maximum regularizaton parameter is 100
Maximal number of regularization parameters (lambda) used for trials: 50


Target misfit is 1
Stagnation factor is 0.025 (the inversion stagnate when the relative difference of misfits at 2 consecutive iterations is smaller than this factor)

Maximum number of iterations for the conjugate gradient method is 100.Tolerance value for the conjugate gradient method is 1e-06

Maximum number of Gauss-Newton iterations: 9

Model density contrast limits: [-300, 300]kg/m3

The inversion mesh will be adaptively refined at every 1 iteration. The mesh may be refined for 8 times AT MOST
For each time of refinement, 10% of cells are marked for refinement. BUT the exact number of cells that are refined might not be this number owing to the some refinement constraints used in the algorithm (e.g. limit of cell sizes, and the difference in the levels of adjacent elements in the tree must not exceed 1).

Cells whose sizes are smaller than 0.5(deg in latitude), 0.5(deg in longitude), 20000(m in depth) cannot be refined.

Will the inversion model be recorded at each iteration? Yes

Use cross-gradient constraint model? No
Use petrophysical constraint model? No
