# How the sensitivity matrix is store, and how the conjugate gradient method is implemented
# 0: store a full sensitivity matrix, and use the lscg implementation of Eigen 3 library (not recommended) (lscg: least square conjugate gradient method)

# 2: use the wavelet transform to compress the sensitivity matrix, and use my own implementation of the lscg method

# A larger threshold results in larger compression ratio, and larger approximation error as well
